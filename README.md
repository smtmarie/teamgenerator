# Team Generator

In this project, I built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, I had to ensure that all unit tests pass.

This full stack application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

## User Story
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.
